# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-CNN
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different categories, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.
